{"name":"Rdiff-backup","tagline":"Reverse differential backup tool, over a network or locally.","body":"### Rdiff-backup is reverse differential backup\r\n\r\nrdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possible over a network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if it is running as root), modification times, acls, eas, resource forks, etc. Finally, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted. \r\n\r\nSol1 has officially taken over stewardship of rdiff-backup from February 2016. Sol1 has long been a contributor and user of rdiff-backup, and will maintain the open source nature of rdiff-backup, while bringing it into the modern era.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe wiki contains documentation on use cases, and serves as a respository of scripts for people to contribute to.
